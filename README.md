Programming language samples -- personal language sandbox
=======

This is just a very tiny collection of very tiny programs whose sole purpose
is to allow me to play around with new languages in a more organised manner.
(I got the idea -- that is, I *copied* the idea -- from my old roommate, Brett Cannon
of Python core fame. It's a good one, so I'll imitate: Brett, if you read this,
keep in mind it's the sincerest form of flattery.)
